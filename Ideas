Hackathon Project Ideas

1. Drone Network to deliver and receive packages
2. More efficient PassioGo path to minimize wait time and stop
3. Database for all things sustainable (names ideas: EcoNiner, -)
4. High-level GPS that automatically selects the most efficient pathway to classes, bus routes, etc.
5. 

5. Transportation app that connects to multiple UNC Charlotte databases such as course scheduling, parking, etc. 
It'll tell students both in and off campus the most sustainable method for getting to their classes. They will import 
their course schedules for the coming semester, and it'll remind you to leave for your class on time based on the time 
it'll take you to get there depending on if you're walking, driving, etc. In terms of driving, the app will tell users 
whether decks have available parking or not. Because every UNC Charlotte student is required to have this app, when parking
gates check your license plate to let you gain access to the deck, it'll update the database for each deck thus telling all
students whether a deck is full or not. 


Example of Existing App Features:
- JouleBug: Gamifies being eco-friendly
- Olio: Connects users to each other to share objects
- TooGoodToGo: Shows restaurants with a surplus of food to distribute
- OroEco: Personal carbon footprint tracker
- GreenScreen: Tells you the composition of what you are recycling/getting rid of (helps recycling)
